# react-native-bpg-example

## Getting started

This is a test project based on react-native-bpg module.

### Mostly automatic installation

```>  npm i```

```> react-native-cli start```

### Manual installation

NDK should be installed. This can be done with SDK manager.

Project should contain ```./android/local.properties``` with correct paths to SDK/NDK (it is possible to set up environment variables). 

Windows example:
```
sdk.dir=D\:\\Development\\_SDK\\AndroidSDK\\AndroidSDK
ndk.dir=D\:\\Development\\_SDK\\AndroidSDK\\ndk-bundle
```

_**This file included in current repo but values should be changed to real ones.**_
